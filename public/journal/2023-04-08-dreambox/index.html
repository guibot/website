<h2 id="dreambox">Dreambox</h2>

<p>Dreambox is an installation that takes me to a mental corner, where dreams, ideas, and memories reside. These mental entities have a life of their own, they can be more or less active, pulsate in synchrony or asynchrony, they can fall asleep completely leaving only one active, or even none.</p>
<p>This installation began with the need to decorate one of the spaces in the &ldquo;Circular Corner&rdquo; (Canto Circular) at <a href="https://www.largoresidencias.com/">Largo de Residências</a>. The &ldquo;Circular Corner&rdquo; includes the &ldquo;Community Cabinet&rdquo; (Armário Comunitário) where you can exchange objects, and the &ldquo;Community Cabinet&rdquo; where you can exchange clothes, and this is where Dreambox is located.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/OQMw">https://youtu.be/OQMw</a>_LAYRII</p>
<p>Having identified the location to intervene, I found these plastic boxes on <a href="https://blab.pt/">Blab</a>, and immediately saw their graphic and aesthetic potential.<br>
After some tests with the lights, it was decided that this was the way to go.</p>
<p><img src="images/boxes.jpg" alt=""> <a href="https://guilhermemartins.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boxes.jpg"></a><img src="images/test1.jpg" alt=""><a href="https://guilhermemartins.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/test1.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I wanted to place the boxes on the wall in a non-obvious and somewhat deconstructed way, as if the boxes had been falling over time. I did a series of tests in Photoshop until I found a pattern that I liked.</p>
<p><a href="https://guilhermemartins.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mockups.mov">https://guilhermemartins.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mockups.mov</a> <img src="images/luzes-1024x648.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Regarding the lighting, it consists of leftovers from Neon LED strips.</p>
<p><img src="images/controlbox-1024x738.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The control box with all the electronics made with PVC.</p>
<p><a href="https://guilhermemartins.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/night">https://guilhermemartins.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/night</a>_studies2_opt.mp4</p>
<p>For each light, I&rsquo;m using a <a href="http://shorturl.at/mrHR7">Mosfet</a>. These Mosfets have an LED on the board, which allowed me to simulate all the light behaviors at the lab.</p>
<p>As I wanted the lights to have various behaviors, I decided to use a motion sensor (PIR), and as a redundancy, I added a microwave sensor that detects changes in electromagnetic fields. With these detections, the different states alternate.</p>
<p><img src="images/sensor-768x346.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Different states/behaviors of the lights:</p>
<p><a href="https://guilhermemartins.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/heartbeat">https://guilhermemartins.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/heartbeat</a>_h264.mp4</p>
<p>Heartbeat:</p>
<p>All lights pulsate in unison, referring to the various ideas/dreams/memories that pulsate simultaneously in our minds, whether it&rsquo;s due to multitasking, being unfocused, having multiple concerns, or simply being multi-dreamers.</p>
<p><a href="https://guilhermemartins.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/randomfades">https://guilhermemartins.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/randomfades</a>_h264.mp4</p>
<p>Random Fade In/Out:</p>
<p>Similar to Heartbeat, but asynchronous. Disparate ideas/dreams/memories competing for attention. An unfocused mind or excessive mental activity.</p>
<p><a href="https://guilhermemartins.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/unique">https://guilhermemartins.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/unique</a>_h264.mp4</p>
<p>Individual Activity:</p>
<p>A single active light, as if our mental focus were acute, with active consciousness and a mind filled with a single thought. Mindfulness, Nirvana.</p>
<p>This was my first solo installation after more than a decade of developing commercial projects for clients.</p>
<p>I would like to give a special thanks to Sónia Sousa (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/Lady.Maker/">@Lady.Maker</a>) for the invitation and challenge to participate in the &ldquo;Canto Circular&rdquo; and for believing in me to carry out this project. To the crew of Blab Colectivo Maker (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/blablabpt/">@blablapt</a>) for all the help and availability. And to Largo de Residências (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/largoresidencias/">@largoresidencias</a>) for supporting and encouraging these initiatives.</p>
<p>It is also an honor to be next to &ldquo;Masya, é uma instalação&rdquo; by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/m41.m/">@m41.m</a>, and to see how these two works coexist and communicate so well with each other in the end.</p>

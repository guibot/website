## The Sounds of Beads, the Texture Synthesizer

Beads, from Mutable Instruments is well known for not being everyone's "cup of tea", and it's absolutely understandable.  
  
I've been fighting with Beads since I bought it, to the point that I considered selling it. But before doing so, and to avoid any regrets I wanted to give a final try, and doing a final effort to at least understand how it works.

Today I see it as a beast that plays a game where he's the master, no matter what. It's a beautiful tool to explore and wander.

So here's my take on Beads :)

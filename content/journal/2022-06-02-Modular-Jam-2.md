## Modular Jam #2

My jam sessions tend to always lead me to deep drones and ambient atmospheres, and its becoming a confort zone, so I've been trying to runaway from this place and explore other sonic realms.  
  
Everything was recorded directly from the rack to an Zoom H6, one stereo track for the drums, other stereo track for the rest of the instruments. Edited the drums track in Live, attenuate the hihats a bit and compressed all the mix slightly.  
  
There's a crossfade on the video, otherwise it would be repetive and boring to watch. Still so much to learn :)

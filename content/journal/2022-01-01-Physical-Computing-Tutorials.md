This is my humble contribution to the internauts, showing how to interface with physical stuff.  
I've been developing physical interfaces for a couple of years, from robotics to electronic musical instruments and other physical devices to be used in interactive installations.  
In this [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/GuilhermeMartins) channel, I will be sharing experiments hoping they will be useful for someone.  

Here's a list of the tutorials I have made so far.

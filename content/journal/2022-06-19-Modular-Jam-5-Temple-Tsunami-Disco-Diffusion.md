I started to play with Disco Diffusion a couple of days ago, and I really got overwhelmed by its simplicity and power.  
This video is composed by a set of short animations, with simple prompts like “Temple sitting on an ocean with a huge tidal wave” or “sitting in the clouds with the form of a tsunami”.  
The animations were mixed in After Effects and sent to FlowFrame.https://nmkd.itch.io/flowframesBrought everything back to After Effects, re-arranged the composition and stretched everything about 300% and applied Frame Blending with Optical Flow.This workflow is just an experiment, and not a final recipe. My exploration continues.  
The sound was recorded live using a modular system.

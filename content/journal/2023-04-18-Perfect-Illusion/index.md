This musical piece explores the Buddhist idea of Maya - the illusion of objective reality that surrounds us. Immerse yourself in the sounds and rhythms of this musical voyage, that leads us to reflect on the impermanent and interdependent nature of all things, and to free ourselves from the illusion that imprisons us. Let yourself be carried away by the music and the beauty of life, and allow it to lead you to a deeper and more meaningful understanding of existence.

## The Sounds of 0-Coast, Krell Patch

Recreating this patch is a challenge many modular musicians like to tackle. It is based on the 1959 movie Forbidden Planet, in a segment where they supposedly play the music of the ancient Krell race. In general terms, each note has a random pitch, envelope, and duration. Buchla expert Todd Barton is often pointed to as the reference on how to create this patch; he has a video on [Vimeo.](https://vimeo.com/48466272)

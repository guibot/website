[Glimmer](https://microaudiowaves.net/glimmer/) is the new album by [Micro Audio Waves](https://microaudiowaves.net/), and just like in the past [Zoetrope](https://guilhermemartins.net/zoetrope/), they partnership with the coreographer Rui Horta to create an unique and immersive concert experience. Just like in Zoetrope, I was once again privileged in being inside this epic journey. 

My work consisted in creating visual digital contents, writing a custom software in [Touchdesigner](http://derivative.ca) to agregate videos and interactive visual contents, LED strips control, and also to trigger syncronized events to Ableton Live and GrandMA Light Mixer.

For me this was a massive challenge, to be able to do everything from scratch on a tight timeline, easy to manage and update,, and also easy to operate live.

In this video I'm showing a little bit of the Sync/Trigger Program made in [Cycling 74 MAX](https://cycling74.com/). This one sends a trigger to Touchdesigner and simultaneously to [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/).  
If there is a precount bit in ableton Live it delays the trigger to TD. This way the videos are always in sync with the audio.

The link between Max and TouchDesigner is through OSC.  
The link between Max and Ableton Live is via RTPMidi.

There are two computers running the same TouchDesigner program, in case of failure, the other computer takes control. There's an HDMI switch to commute from one output to the other.

There are also two computers running the same Ableton Live Session, syncronized with an [iConnectivity](https://www.iconnectivity.com/) interface. My Max program sends a Midi command to iConnectivity, and this command is sent to both Live instances, to [TazLite](https://www.oaktone.com/products/taz-lite) plugin.  
  
The following images show a little bit of my visual art for Glimmer.

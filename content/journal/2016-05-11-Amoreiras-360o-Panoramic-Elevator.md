In September 2015 we did a project for [State of the Art](http://www.sotaart.com/) to develop a few installations to celebrate [30 Anos Amoreiras](https://artica.cc/blog/2015/09/04/30-anos-amoreiras.html). Amongst this installation was an elevator simulator, decorated with TV screens and LED strips. The simulator was promoting the upcoming opening of a [360 Panoramic View](http://www.amoreiras360view.com/) in the top of Amoreiras Shopping tower.

The project had it’s usual share of setbacks that a project of this size usually has, so we are quite happy to see it operating well and already open to the public.

The elevator is located at Amoreiras Shopping Center, taking guests all the way to 18th floor to enjoy the 360 degree Panoramic View. More information about the viewpoint can be found at [http://www.amoreiras360view.com/](http://www.amoreiras360view.com/).

## About

This is a practice focused on exploring the boundaries between computational systems, sound design, and interactive media.

The work operates at the intersection of:
- Generative and algorithmic composition
- Real-time audiovisual systems
- Interactive installations and performances
- Process-based research and experimentation

Rather than producing discrete works, the focus is on developing ongoing systems—frameworks for creation that evolve over time through iteration, testing, and reconfiguration.

### Collaboration

Open to collaborations with artists, researchers, cultural institutions, and experimental collectives working at the edges of art and technology.

## WHO

I’m a Creative Technologist and Experimental Systems Designer.
I design and build systems at the intersection of art and technology.
My work focuses on creating meaningful experiences through systems, not isolated works.

## HOW

My practice is grounded in experimentation, prototyping and iteration.
I work across hardware, software and physical interfaces, developing systems that evolve over time and generate multiple outputs, contexts or uses.

## WHY

I’m interested in making systems legible and tangible, where technology is sometimes hidden, othertimes felt, played and experienced. My process explores how people relate to complex systems through visuals, sound, and interaction.

## COLLABORATION

I’m open to collaborations, commissions and research contexts where process, experimentation and autonomy are central.

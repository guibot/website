An attempt to create an artificial ecosystem that explores dynamics inherent to human nature.  
This ecosystem is composed of autonomous agents that mirror human traits: behaviour, ideology, hunger, happiness, power, resources, and territory.  
The simulation evolves on its own, driven solely by the interactions between these agents.

Are we conditioned for division, manipulation, competition, and conflict?  
My algorithm suggests yes, although it might be just a mistake of my algorithm.

## Exploring spatial soundscapes with body location

This prototype is a proof of concept for location-based sound exploration.

Each participant/VIVE tracker has a sound attached, this sound follows the participant inside the room. If the participant moves to a corner the sound becomes more audible in that specific corner. This video shows a proof of concept in a small room, the same concept can be applied in any room size, or even in large venues.  
Follow the video's link for a full description.

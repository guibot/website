Vimana is a personal interpretation of a Multi-track Midi Step Sequencer with an Open Philosophy regarding the User Interface

![](Vimana_2-1024x622.jpg)

I have been working on this project during the last 4 years, and today, I'm presenting it to the world as it is right now.  
Vimana is also my submission to the MIDI Awards 2022. 
  
Below is a list of the main features that are implemented:  
  
16 independent MIDI channels/tracks  
Main clock, division/multiplication per track  
Step parameters: pitch, velocity, gate, retrigger, repeat, chord, inversions, sustain  
Play mode: forward, reverse, pendulum, random, drunk  
Built-in Quantizer with many different scales, and also the possibility of setting a custom scale.  
Euclidean Generator

Vimana stands upon an open philosophy regarding the physical user interface. As a developer and a musician, I wanted to be able to build multiple instruments according to the need of the project, or the moment. For this I have created a modular user interface from the physical point of view, but also from the software point of view. Let’s say that we need a step sequencer with 5 steps and 3 tracks only, or a gate sequencer for drums and rhythms with as many steps and pages and tracks, it is all possible with this system, it’s just a matter of changing variables and voila. CPU is the limit here, and since we have a [Teensy](http://pjrc.com) platform as the brain, we have a lot of free ground to play with.

In the video below I have an intrument ensemble in Ableton Live, and I'm using Vimana to play them all.

Other instances and prototypes of Step Sequencers, testing different layouts and user interfaces.

The video below shows how it all started, the 1st prototype of a step sequencer. When I accomplish this concept, I knew I could create something way better.
